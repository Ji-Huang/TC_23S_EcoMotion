2. For the parameters of the CAD model, please refer to *CAD_size.pdf*

3. Tips for modeling: First draw half of the model as a stack of cylinders, and make a sketch on the side of the rotor, extrude and cut out the air gap. Then mirror the half model with respect to this surface to create the complete model.  Finally, project the air gap sketch onto another reference surface and extrude the magnet with preferably a different color.
